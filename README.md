# RSS feed widget for KDE Plasma 6

A barebones widget for displaying an RSS feed. Shows the title, timestamp, and
description (without images) of each feed item. Clicking on a feed item opens
its link in the default browser.

Rescued and adapted for Plasma 6. This was originally written by Andreas Loos,
2015, and includes selected contributions from Mircea Kitsune, 2017-2018.
